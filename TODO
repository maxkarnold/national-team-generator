# PROJECT TODO LIST

## PRIORITIES

- Restore project to previous functionality on the same level as the deployed website
- Make sure to keep code encapsulated / create more files like utils and consts to store reusable code / create services for different processes that should be removed from the front end as much as possible
- Use eslint/prettier to rewrite the code

## LONG TERM PLANS

- Create playable tournaments
- potentially move to React
- potentially move to IndexedDB (something on the client side, like local storage)

## SECONDARY (NEED TO VERIFY IF NECESSARY)

- Optimize file sizes to fit build size budget for Angular
- Fix loading leaderboard bug
- Fix alt positions so that they aren't undefined and duplicate positions
- Fix first name and last name creation so that the right number of names is created
- Create tooltip modal for players to better view their stats/attributes

## TERTIARY (NEED TO VERIFY IF NECESSARY)

- add more clubs to clubs.json in the lower tiers to add more variety
- change the foot property to have no "either" string (very weak, weak, reasonable, strong, very strong), descriptions for each foot
- Add the ability to click on players, to move them to a new position. (For Mobile)
- Two options:
  1. Allow the ability to move pitchPlayers from the expansion panels.
  2. Create an alert/warning that you can't move players off the pitch from the expansion panel.
- Add chemistry to UI with FM (partnerships) or FIFA (chemistry) method
- Add random cities as birthplaces for players
- create a guide page or a tutorial to help understand the generator
- When dragging a player within the pitch UI, the original position box goes away. Add a placeholder, so that it doesn't look weird and you can place the player back.
- Update the UI so the buttons are more compact and the data/players are easier to get to.
- Need to fix bulgarian surnames to not include feminine surnames
- Add a function that creates or grabs a random Brazilian/Spanish nickname
